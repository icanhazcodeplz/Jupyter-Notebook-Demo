    "# Jupyter Notebook Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is adapted from https://github.com/TwistedHardware/mltutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment that spawned from the IPython Notebook that only supported Python. Jupyter supports Python 2, Python 3, and many other languages including:\n",
    "* [Ruby](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby)\n",
    "* [C#](https://github.com/zabirauf/icsharp)\n",
    "* [Lua](https://github.com/pakozm/IPyLua)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list is available [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages). This demo will only use Python 3. I'll leave it up you to investigate other languages :).\n",

    "# Why is it called jupyter?\n",
    "<img src=\"images/jupyter-main-logo.svg\" style=\"width: 200px\"> \n",
    "[Fernando Perez](https://twitter.com/fperez_org) suggests in [this talk](http://youtu.be/JDrhn0-r9Eg?t=6m14s) that the name initially came from the desire to support Julia and R within IPython Notebook. Thus:\n",
    "$$Julia + Python + R = jupyter$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The other reason\n",
    "Galileo documented his observations of Jupiter's moons and published them in *Starry Messenger* in 1610. In it, he proved that the Earth orbits the Sun-like Jupiter's moons orbit Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I therefore concluded and decided unhesitatingly, that there are three stars in the heavens moving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun; which at length was established as clear as daylight by numerous subsequent observations. These observations also established that there are not only three, but four, erratic sidereal bodies performing their revolutions round Jupiter...the revolutions are so swift that an observer may generally get differences of position every hour.\"\n",
    ">\n",

    "\n",
    "Sharing these conclusions in a way that could be replicated and verified inspired the modern scientific method. This is what Jupyter Notebooks are used for; sharing the complete process with others to verify your process and replicate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What it does\n",
    "In practical terms, Notebooks allow you to use markdown cells around code cells to document your code. You are currently reading a markdown cell. Below is a code cell. There is a drop-down bar in the toolbar allows you to change this. To run a cell, click the play button in the toolbar. Also, check out all the shortcut keys by clicking 'Help' --> 'Keyboard Shortcuts'."

    "# Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Base http://localhost:8888/tree\n",
    "  * Directory Navigator\n",
    "  * Built-in terminal\n",
    "  * See what notebooks or terminals are currently running\n",
    "  * See Conda environments\n",
    "  * Text editor with syntax highlighting for many languages\n",
    "  * Extensions (see below)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "  There are some awesome [extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) that are automatically installed with Anaconda. To see them, do the following:\n",
    "  * Navigate to http://localhost:8888/nbextensions/\n",
    "  * Under *Configurable extensions* click *Nbextensions dashboard tab*\n",
    "  * Reload your [home base](http://localhost:8888/tree). You should now see a **Nbextensions** tab next to **Conda**\n",
    "  * Explore some of the options! \n",
    "  \n",
    "Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get some of the extensions to work. Here are my favorites (so far) that worked for me:\n",
    "  * **Hide input all**: Nice when presenting your notebook to non-coders\n",
    "  * **Navigation-Hotkeys**: Automatically puts you back in edit mode when you run a cell.\n",
    "  * **AutoSaveTime**: Allows you to set the autosave time. I'm not convinced this actually works though...\n",
    "  * **Launch QTConsole**: This one is AWESOME. Allows you to develop code with one-liners as well as cells.\n",
    "  * **ExecuteTime**: Shows how long it took a cell to run. I turn this off when presenting my notebook to others.\n",
    "  * **spellchecker**: Doesn't give suggestions, but it's better than nothing!\n",
    "  * **Tree Filter**: Allows you to filter on file names in the directory tree. Note that it's case sensitive.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### [Widgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets)\n",
    "  * sliders\n",
    "  * progress bars\n",
    "  * text boxes\n",
    "  * toggle buttons and check-boxes\n",
    "  * display areas\n",
    "  * and more\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Static File Server\n",
    "  * You can serve static files using https://url:port/files/%FILE_PATH% like https://0.0.0.0:8888/files/myproject/README.html\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Jupyter Drive\n",
    "  * You can share Jupyter Notebooks from your Google Drive using [Jupyter Drive](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive). This allows you share Jupyter Notebooks with all the access control that Google Drive provides.\n",
    "  * **Disclamer**: I have not actually tried Jupyter Drive\n",
    " \n",
    "### Notebook Present\n",
    "  * This is a new(ish) feature from Anaconda that allows you to \"turn your notebooks into powerful PowerPoint-style presentations\".\n",
    "  * I personally prefer to present by just scrolling down the notebook, but if you REALLY need a powerpoint style, check out their documentation [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/jupyter-notebook-extensions#notebook-present)\n",
    "  * It's not the most intuitive interface, but I can see how it could be very useful.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### [Jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)\n",
    "  * From the github README: \"With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub which spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook (IPython notebook) server.\"\n",
    "  * I haven't tried this yet but plan to soon. Very cool!\n"
